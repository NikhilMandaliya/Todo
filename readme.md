# Todo APIs

Simple REST API built using Node.js for a TODO application. The API is designed to handle user authentication, profile management, and task management. PostgreSQL is used as the database, and Sequelize is the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for interacting with the database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- PostgreSQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NikhilMandaliya/Todo.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd todo
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the PostgreSQL database and add your database credentials in .env file.

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The API should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`
   
   I've provided a Postman collection (`todo.postman.json`) to help you test the API endpoints conveniently.

This project was created as a personal learning endeavor to explore and understand PostgreSQL database integration with Sequelize ORM in a Node.js environment. Feel free to use, modify, or contribute to enhance the functionality as you see fit.
